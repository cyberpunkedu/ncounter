# nCounter

How long has it been since the last nCounter? Trying to start something or trying to quit something on a daily basis? Enter the event date and name, then press 'Track' to find out how long it has been. Details appear in the user metrics on the lock screen.

Only one item is trackable. Stay focused one day at a time.

## How to build

Set up [clickable](https://github.com/bhdouglass/clickable) and run `clickable` inside the working directory.

## Credits
